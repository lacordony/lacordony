<h1 align="center">Hi 👋 I'm Laetitia</h1>
<h3 align="center">A software developer, former HR (yes, that's possible :muscle:)</h3>

⚡ Fun fact : **My nickname is Georgia because of one of my character in a role playing game**

<h3 align="left">Experience</h3>

I'm java developer for 4 years, i'm working mostly with **Java** and **Spring** <a href="https://www.java.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/java/java-original.svg" alt="java" width="30" height="30"/> </a>

I worked for energy sector and automotive sector. My job was to develop java interfaces between 2 of their softwares to migrate data from one software to another.

I'm not really a front-end lover, I'm using mostly **Bootstrap** or **Bulma** to avoid CSS as much as possible. To be honest, I'm not really into the "full stack" thing. I tried different JS frameworks and libs like React, Angular, Vue but I never had the feeling with them.

<h3 align="left">Goals</h3>

About missions and projects, I'm interested in **climate change🌳, zero waste 🚮, animal rights🐶, green IT :computer:** and I'd love to find a job with a green objective.

About tech skills, my top priority is to improve as much as possible on my core stack : Java ecosystem.

Then, I'd love to develop skills in **CI/CD** <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/docker/docker-original.svg" alt="docker" width="30" height="30"/></a> or **Cloud** like AWS or GCP to have a larger view on global IT architecture and not just development.

<h3 align="left">Projects</h3>

I have created a [Github Pages](https://devgeorgia.github.io/) to share some knowledge and capitalize my own progression. I chose to use french language for this project because it's more a personal thing.

I'll share the other ones with you soon.
